📍 based in strasbourg, France

## how I work?

I value **clarity over ~~complexity~~**

**<ins>my work process:<ins/>**

1️⃣ speak with the client to understand their context

2️⃣ clarify the real pain points

3️⃣ define a simple roadmap

4️⃣ prioritise by impact vs effort (small dev time + high business impact first)

5️⃣ ship fast and improve through feedback

## outside of tech
